    <h1>Dots & Boxes!</h1>
    <div class="wrapper">
        <!-- https://www.gamesforyoungminds.com/blog/2018/12/23/dots-and-boxes -->
    <p> Each player takes turns connecting adjacent dots (represented in my project by images of my face), either vertically or horizontally.

        The goal is to claim as many boxes as possible. If you draw the fourth side of a box, you claim that square and the box is filled in with your color. <br>If you claim a box, you get another turn, which means you can potentially claim multiple boxes on a single turn.
        
        The game ends when all lines have been drawn, all boxes have been claimed, and the person with the most boxes wins!
    <br>
    Extra Feature : Be careful as trying to cheat by drawing a line over an opponent will be punished by skipping your turn!</p>
